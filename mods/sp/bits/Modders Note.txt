So, there is only reason for you to read this file, and I dont need to read your mind, so I am going to go straight to the point.



1) You cannot use any of my assets for commercial products.

2) I allow anyone to use units, vehicles, aircraft and defences that I (Nolt) made as long as im credited.

3) While I cannot force people to do what they want with my assets, if you want to stay on my good side, do not use my building sets,

   using them on your mod just makes them look like a clone of mine, you would be better off getting blender.

4) About using assets that are not mine, ask the author.
